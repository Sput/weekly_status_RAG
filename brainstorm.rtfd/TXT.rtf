# Initial Explanation Stage\
\
Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.\
\
Here is exactly what I need implemented:\
\
1. Introduction: This application will be used to track weekly status updates delivered by team members, and we will use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to make the data available during daily use. \
 \
2. Objectives & Goals: Users will log in multiple times a week to update on what they are working on. They will provide update on the status of projects. Other users will be able to see updates their teammates make. The text from these status updates will be included in LLM queries about on-going work to make it easier for co-workers to engage actively with work status. \
\
3. Target Users & Roles: Team Member: these people will provide status on projects. These people also will have access to the updates their teammates have made. Managers: these people have access to updates their teammates have made.   \
\
4. Core Features for MVP: Form for Team Members to update their project status. Form to see project status for other team members. Chat page that uses team members project status to augment queries with gpt-4o-mini conversation\
\
5. Future Scope: none\
\
6. User Journey: Team Member: user logs in -> presented with form of their current project status -> user provides updated information on their projects -> user sees their updated project status along with other team members most recent status -> when a user engages with the chat page that current status for themselves and other team members are included in the query. Manager: user logs in -> user sees current project status for all users -> \cf2 when a user engages with the chat page that current status for themselves and other team members are included in the query.\cf2 \
\
\
7. Tech Stack: Front-end: Javascript, React, shadcn; Business logic: python; database: Postgres hosted by Supabase\
\
\
User updates project status -> user sees project status for themselves and teammebers ->project status data is included in chat queries using RAG\
\
Your responsibilities:\
\
- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.\
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.\
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.\
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.\
\
Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.\

Once you've answered all of GPT-5's questions and it has nothing more to ask, paste in this prompt:\

# Plan Creation Stage\
\
Based on our full exchange, now, produce a markdown plan document (`{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/D3A6TySWHM"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs2 \cf4 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 http://\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs34 \cf4 \cb3 plan.md}}`).\
\
Requirements for the plan:\
\
- Include clear, minimal, concise steps.\
- Track the status of each step using these emojis:\
  - \cf2 {{\NeXTGraphic 1f7e9.svg \width720 \height720 \appleattachmentpadding0 \appleembedtype0 \appleaqc
}¬}\cf2  Done\
  - \cf2 {{\NeXTGraphic 1f7e8.svg \width720 \height720 \appleattachmentpadding0 \appleembedtype0 \appleaqc
}¬}\cf2  In Progress\
  - \cf2 {{\NeXTGraphic 1f7e5.svg \width720 \height720 \appleattachmentpadding0 \appleembedtype0 \appleaqc
}¬}\cf2  To Do\
- Include dynamic tracking of overall progress percentage (at top).\
- Do NOT add extra scope or unnecessary complexity beyond explicitly clarified details.\
- Steps should be modular, elegant, minimal, and integrate seamlessly within the existing codebase.\

```\
\
Again, for clarity, it's still not time to build yet. Just write the clear plan document. No extra complexity or extra scope beyond what we discussed. The plan should lead to simple, elegant, minimal code that does the job perfectly.\

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.\
\
Implementation Requirements:\
\
- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.\
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.\
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.\
- As you implement each step:\
  - Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically.\
